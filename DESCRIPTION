Description: The Plate Boundary Observatory is the geodetic
    component of the EarthScope project, and maintains a
    large network of instruments, including continuous GPS,
    longbase laser strainmeters, and borehole strainmeters.
    This package provides access to  metadata associated
    with these stations, and some data products.
    Note that the metadata is a compilation from multiple
    sources, and is only current up to the version number, which
    has the following format: version.year.day-of-year.
    The data products currently supported include:
    pore-fluid pressure, and
    pore-fluid temperature.
