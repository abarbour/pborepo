Feel free to contact me (@abarbour) should you wish to see other data included.  More information may be found on the [PBO website](http://pbo.unavco.org/).\r\n\r\nThis website is organized by the section headings, with links to the @github \"blobs\" for each dataset; from there you can access the raw data should you need to.  The section at the end of the page ([NEWS](http://abarbour.github.com/pborepo#NEWS)) lists brief descriptions of any changes or significant updates.\r\n\r\nPBO borehole strainmeters (BSM)\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n[`bsm_azimuths`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/bsm_azimuths)\r\n* Orientations of the individual BSM channels **Note: if Ch0==0 then it is an assumed value (and likely not correct)**\r\n\r\n[`bsm_coords`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/bsm_coords)\r\n* Coordinates of BSM stations, from the latest listing.\r\n\r\n[`bsm_gaps`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/bsm_geps)\r\n* By station: capacitance-bridge gap separations, install/lin. dates; these are generally used for strain data linearization.\r\n\r\n[`bsm_igppGeod`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/bsm_igppGeod)\r\n* Geodetics from my office to the PBO BSM sites.\r\n\r\n[`bsm_regions`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/bsm_regions)\r\n* Regional classifications; these are found in the long (16-character) station names.\r\n\r\nPBO longbase laser strainmeters (LSM)\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[`lsm_coords`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/lsm_coords)\r\n* Coordinates and counts-to-strain scalings for LSM sites, including inactive\r\n`YMS`, and non-PBO sites: `PFO[123]` and `DHL1`.\r\n\r\nPBO continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) stations\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[`cgps_coords`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/cgps_coords)\r\n* coordinates of continuous gps sites, from latest listing\r\n\r\nPBO borehole network\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n[`pbo_stations_raw`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/pbo_stations_raw)\r\n* This is a raw listing of PBO stations, from NCEDC/IRIS-DMC; the values are comma-separated and some fields have character strings in quotations.\r\n\r\n**Note: the following are derived from the raw listing:**\r\n\r\n[`pbo_stations_instrumentcount`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/pbo_stations_instrumentcount)\r\n* Counts of the various instrument types in the network.\r\n\r\n[`pbo_stations_accel`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/pbo_stations_accel)\r\n* List of stations having strong motion accelerometers.\r\n\r\n[`pbo_stations_bsm`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/pbo_stations_bsm)\r\n* List of stations having borehole strainmeters.\r\n\r\n[`pbo_stations_lsm`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/pbo_stations_lsm)\r\n* List of stations having laser strainmeters.\r\n\r\n[`pbo_stations_pp`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/pbo_stations_pp)\r\n* List of stations having pore pressure sensors.\r\n\r\n[`pbo_stations_seis`](https://github.com/abarbour/pborepo/blob/master/pbo_stations_seis)\r\n* List of stations having seismometers (geophones).\r\n\r\nNEWS\r\n====\r\n* January 2013 (website branch added)"}
